$d082 - wLowHealthAlarm - safe if you leave it at $00
$d09f - wDisableVBlankWYUpdate - probably not important for ACE
$d121 - wVBlankSavedROMBank - safe if you leave it unset - written to save the VBlank ROM bank, read back
$d139 - wIgnoreInputCounter - safe if you leave it at $00 - otherwise it'll mess with joypad input
$d499 - wPrinterConnectionOpen - safe if you leave it at $00
$d479 - wd47a - can be safely used, related to play time
$d72b - wd72c - can be safely used

$d731 - wd732 - can be safely used, related to play time
